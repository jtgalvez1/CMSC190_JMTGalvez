# PeakOne: Enabling Remote Access to UPLB ICS Technical Reports
Authors: Juan Miguel T. Galvez and Joseph Anthony C. Hermocilla

Conducting research on previous studies have been limited to physical libraries. PeakOne was created to augment the research process by providing a convenient way of accessing resources within the UPLB ICS. The service allows researchers to remotely view research papers that may be relevant to their study and also aid by providing ways to save resources for later viewing and displaying research that they have read before. Current users found the service to be usable and would recommend its use to their peers.
